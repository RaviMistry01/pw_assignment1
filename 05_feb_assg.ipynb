Each car object created from the Car class will have its own values for these properties and will be able to perform the actions defined by the methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1)Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the users. It helps in reducing the complexity of the system and improving its readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data and functions that manipulate the data within a single unit or object. It helps in protecting the data from the outside world and ensuring that the data is safe and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3)Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits the properties and behaviors of the existing class and can also add new properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4) Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call differently. It allows objects to be treated as objects of their class or objects of its parent class. It makes the code more flexible and reusable."
