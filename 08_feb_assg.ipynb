All you need to know is how to start the car, how to steer it, how to accelerate and brake, and how to use the lights and indicators.

    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system to the user. It allows the user to interact with the system at a higher level of abstraction, without worrying about the low-level details. For example, a car driver only needs to know how to drive the car, without knowing the details of how the engine or transmission work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of hiding internal data and methods of an object from the outside world, and allowing access to them only through a well-defined interface. It ensures that the object's state is not modified directly by external code, but only through the object's methods. For example, a bank account object may have a method to withdraw money, but the balance of the account is not directly accessible from outside the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation, consider the example of a smartphone. The user of the smartphone interacts with its high-level features, such as making calls, sending messages, and using apps. These features are abstracted from the internal workings of the smartphone, such as its operating system, hardware components, and software libraries. This abstraction allows the user to interact with the phone at a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, ensures that the internal workings of the smartphone are hidden from the outside world. For example, the user cannot directly access the phone's memory or modify its hardware components. Instead, the user interacts with the phone through a well-defined interface, such as a touch screen or a voice command system. This interface provides encapsulation, which protects the phone's internal state and ensures that it is accessed only through authorized methods."
